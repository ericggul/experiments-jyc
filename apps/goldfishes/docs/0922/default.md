# 0922 default

- Route: `/screen/0922/default` (legacy alias: `/0922/default`)
- Date: 2026-09-22
- Baseline: [`0908/overlay-5`](../0908/overlay-5.md), including its current local changes

This began as a standalone, exact copy of overlay-5. The 2026-09-23 blink
experiment now covers all 80 tech-eye sources, including repeated instances,
in this route's `big tech` and `big tech colour` options only. Human eyes and
other dated routes are unchanged. The UI offers `static 2D / blinking 2D / 3D eyeball / 3D blinking`, initially blinking 2D.
Its initial selection remains parameter combination `5`, and combination `4`
remains available in the right-hand controls.

The component modules are local to `0922/default`; the story session key,
renderer log label, generator target, and copied audio asset use the new
experiment identity. Existing 0908 image URLs remain unchanged.

The optional [face and lips 3D studies and full-field expansion](./face-lips-3d-trials.md)
are isolated behind their respective right-panel controls. The original 2D
face and lips options remain the comparison baseline. Both optional 3D modes
now render all 80 identities as geometry. Four faces and 16 lips have
lower-resolution photographic texture, but none stays as a flat 2D fallback.

## 3D eyeballs — 2026-09-23

The separate [80-source 3D eyeball option](./tech-eye-3d.md) preserves both 2D
modes and the default selection. The `3D blinking` option has a `blink speed`
slider, which also controls the 3D `blink all` command. The three requested
`surface` options (`tech`, `colour`, `hieroglyphs`) are absent from this route's
menu; `tech mono` remains. The thin story ring and separator are hidden around
3D eyes. Source/proportion and renderer verification are documented independently
from the 2D blink tests below.

## Manual blink command — 2026-09-23

The accepted automatic version is preserved independently at
[`/screen/0922/blink-auto`](./blink-auto.md). This default adds the right-panel
`blink all` button in tech-eye `blinking 2D` mode. One click starts one blink
on every currently visible, loaded eye; it cancels that eye's pending/ongoing
automatic blink and does not add a double blink. Autonomy resumes after a normal
interval. While the bubble system is paused, the button still works and the
eyes stay open afterwards. Manual input is also permitted under reduced motion;
automatic movement remains suppressed. Hidden/inactive eyes do not queue a
command to replay later. Static 2D disables the button; the later 3D extension
dispatches the same button to its separate volumetric blink renderer.

This is sprite playback, not video: eyelid appearance comes from the existing
WebP frames, while initiation and frame timing are programmatic. The screen-local
controller exposes `blinkAll()` and `blinkEye(storyIndex)` so a later algorithm
can trigger individual eyes through the same path. No decision algorithm or
additional parameter controls have been introduced.

Verification: eight timing/controller tests passed, including command replacement,
individual addressing, instance isolation, pause, reduced motion, and cleanup.
The exact HTTPS route rendered without the reported missing-module error after
the parallel 3D dependency file was present; current app typecheck passed.
In browser testing, all 43 loaded visible eyes received the same button-request
ID while paused and returned open; a screenshot captured their simultaneous
closing phase. No browser errors/warnings were captured. The preserved route
also loaded with automatic blinking selected and no `blink all` button.

## Full tech-eye blinking — 2026-09-23

The initial three-eye trial was accepted, with feedback that the motion felt
slow and too regular. The expanded version uses 206–244 ms blinks, faster
closure than reopening, a 36–44 ms closed dwell, independently sampled entry
delays (180–920 ms), and 2.6–6.8 second recurring intervals. A 12% chance adds
one quick second blink; rapid chains are prevented. These are visual tuning
parameters, not a physiological model.

A stationary open frame holds the surrounding face still. Only an elliptical,
feathered eyelid region advances through the generated frames, reducing skin
and eyebrow drift. Existing brand gradients and global filters are applied
consistently to both layers. Generated open frames remain reconstructions;
`static 2D` restores the original source photos exactly.

80 unique 576×384 WebP sheets total 1,576,742 bytes at this revision; each frame
is 192×192. Their worst-case decoded RGBA footprint is 67.5 MiB before browser
overhead. The two display layers reuse the same image. Mounted cells preload
their sheets, including empty cells, and retain the loaded open photograph through
leaving/empty/entering and pause changes. This fixes the source-photo/crop swap
at bubble transitions. No canvas, video decoder, or per-frame React updates
were added. Hidden documents, bubble pause, and reduced motion stop automatic timing;
reduced motion retains the open sprite frame; a failed load retains the original photo.
The transition fix passed 10 pure tests and typecheck. HTTPS browser sampling
observed 54 colour-mode and 43 original-mode cells changing lifecycle state with
no image URL, background-size, or loaded-layer visibility changes.
Source IDs wrap by the existing 80-person registry, while each instance has
independent timing. Original generated files remain at their recorded paths.

[Asset provenance and generation prompt](../../components/screen/0922/default/source/tech-eye-blink/README.md).
The pure timing tests cover cadence, duration, asymmetrical closure/reopening,
and double blinks. The asset audit checks all 80 sheets and preserved originals.

Final HTTPS review used a temporary 48px-icon layout to expose 91 instances,
including every source and repeated IDs. In original-colour mode, DOM frame
observations recorded closure and subsequent reopening for all 80 sources.
Colour-mode observation recorded 79 distinct closures during its bounded sample;
the remaining source was not observed closing in that interval. Both modes were
visually inspected over more than 32 seconds with no captured browser warnings,
runtime/GPU errors, or device-loss messages. Static and human modes mounted no
blink surfaces, and bubble pause reset all eyelid frames to open. The temporary
test tab was closed. Typecheck, scoped ESLint, four pure timing tests, asset audit
(`checked: 551, missing: 0`), and diff checks passed. No 3D-eye behavior is covered
by this verification.

## Initial three-eye trial

Story indices 0, 1, and 4 (Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Dario Amodei) initially
used generated 3×2 frame sheets under the `blink · 3 eyes` toggle.
Other instances remained static. `static` restored the original photographs. Bubble appearance,
fish, geometry, presets, and existing brand-gradient/global-filter behavior
are retained. The generated open frames are reconstructions, not pixel-identical
original photographs; identity, crop, and skin stability remain quality criteria.

The initial timing was 620–800 ms after entry, then 390–440 ms per blink and
2.6–7 seconds between blinks. These timings were superseded by the full version.

The built-in imagegen tool produced `001.png`, `002.png`, and `005.png` from
their matching `/images/0908/tech-power-eyes/*.jpg` sources. Final prompt:

> Identity-preserving edit for photographic blink sprite sheet. Output
> 1536x1024 landscape, exactly 3 columns by 2 rows of equal SQUARE frames, no
> margins/gaps/borders/labels. Input is the exact eye crop to animate. Keep
> original entire square crop and original eye size/position within each square,
> skin color, eyebrow, glasses if present, lighting, identity. Do not zoom/reframe.
> Six chronological frames read left-to-right then next row: 1 exactly original
> fully open; 2 upper lid 25% closed; 3 upper lid 60% closed; 4 upper lid 85%
> closed; 5 fully gently closed eyelash seam; 6 same fully closed. Photorealistic.
> Upper eyelid slides over fixed eyeball, lower lid only slightly rises. All
> surrounding skin, glasses, eyebrow fixed identically in every cell. No text.
> Preserve source softness. Use natural skin folds, no graphic masks.

Verification: app typecheck and scoped ESLint passed. HTTPS browser inspection
confirmed the static comparison, three sprite surfaces, original-color display,
and no reported browser errors during the initial observation. It exposed a
global step-easing bug that held the open frame. Following a report that blinks
were still invisible, the per-entry delay (up to 4.12 seconds for index 4) was
shortened and Web Animations replaced with explicit frame timers. A pure mock-clock
check verifies closure before 900 ms at midpoint jitter, reopening by 1200 ms,
and timer cleanup/pause for all three indices. Scoped ESLint passes.
After browser reconnection, the exact HTTPS route showed closed eyelids on all
three instances (captured visually in brand-colour mode). DOM frame observations
also confirmed closed → open transitions for all three in original-colour mode;
browser warning/error logs were empty. The original brand-colour selection was
restored. Blinking now works, but these generated frames still reconstruct skin
and eye detail, so this is not yet a claim of hyperrealistic temporal fidelity.
The user accepted this trial and requested the full expansion described above.
