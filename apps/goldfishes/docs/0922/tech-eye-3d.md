# Source-driven 3D eyeballs — 2026-09-23

Route: `/screen/0922/default` → controls → eyes → big tech → `3D eyeball`.
All 80 identities now use live Three.js meshes; repeated story instances reuse
the same identity render. Static 2D, blinking 2D, and the independent blink-all
controller remain available. Default selection stays blinking 2D. The rejected
skin-and-eye option is removed. Fish, story geometry, presets, and timing remain
unchanged.

Each model has an open scleral globe, recessed iris annulus, black pupil cavity,
and protruding transmissive cornea (IOR 1.376). Original photographic iris pixels
provide the colour/pattern; authored radial microstructure, veins, and small
stable shape/tint differences supply detail that the portraits cannot resolve.
Globe size and proportions vary subtly; iris proportion uses the source eye
window plus bounded variation. The final user adjustment increases iris/pupil
diameter by 18% relative to the globe. These are source-driven reconstructions,
not anatomical scans or verified biometric iris models.

The same right panel offers `inspect 3D · drag to rotate`: choose any of the
80 names, drag/use arrow keys, or switch to `original photo` for comparison.
The inspector mounts only while expanded. `big tech colour` intentionally applies
the existing affiliation gradient; `big tech` retains photographic colour.
The existing global backboard filter still affects the scene and inspector.

## Sources and limits

[Generated source ledger](../../components/screen/0922/default/model/tech-eye-3d-profiles.generated.json)
records each exact Commons source, author/license, raster dimensions, eye
coordinates, and acquisition status. Final distribution: 58 Commons thumbnails,
17 Commons originals, 5 previously downloaded Commons rasters; 80 valid Vision
eye contours. Assets live in `public/images/0922/tech-eye-3d/portraits/`.
`source/prepare-tech-eye-3d.mjs` acquires the same photos used by the existing
CEO registry; `inspect-all-eye-landmarks.swift` reads their actual pixels.
Image URLs include dimension versions to avoid stale low-resolution rasters
being sampled with newly generated high-resolution coordinates.

Iris windows remain small even in some larger portraits; glasses, illumination,
occlusion and landmark estimates limit identity fidelity. Unseen anatomy and
microdetail are authored, not recovered. The first generic generated iris atlas
was rejected and removed from runtime; its
[prompt and rejected asset](../../components/screen/0922/default/source/tech-eye-3d-rejected/README.md)
remain local experiment history.

## Bounded rendering

One WebGL context and four instanced meshes serve all identities plus one
inspector. A 1536×1024 live render atlas supplies 128px field cells and a 256px
inspector cell to lightweight 2D presentation canvases. The presented image is
generated from real geometry each update, not a pre-rendered eye sprite.
Seven measured draw calls include the physical transmission capture. Geometry
is shared (492,480 submitted triangles at full fixed instance capacity, including
capture), with five renderer-reported textures. Source decoding is limited to
three concurrent images, loaded lazily. The iris atlas is 1280×1024, sclera
1024×512, plus bounded environment/transmission targets.

DPR is 1; scheduling is capped at 24 Hz, without per-frame React state changes.
Only active identities animate; repeated IDs share their gaze. Pause and reduced
motion stop autonomous gaze; hidden documents stop scheduling. Inspector input
can explicitly invalidate a paused view. Unmount releases geometry, materials,
textures, context, timers, listeners, and pending image loads. Failures retain
the original photograph. The cap is a workload limit, not a FPS guarantee.

Implementation: `model/tech-eye-3d.ts`,
`rendering/tech-eyeball-atlas.ts`, `screen/tech-eye-3d.tsx`; narrow integration
in `screen/index.tsx`. Independent blinking modules and the preserved
`0922/blink-auto` route were not edited.

from total application FPS and CPU submission time from GPU duration.

## Verified baseline

HTTPS clean-load inspection at 1184×684, 600 existing fish, and temporary 48px
icons produced 91 field outputs plus the inspector: all 80 source IDs ready.
Over 61 seconds the eye renderer measured 15.66 updates/s, 2.19 ms average CPU
submission/copy work per update, 7 calls, and 492,480 submitted triangles.
GPU duration and total application FPS were not measured. No new browser
warnings/errors occurred. Pause froze its frame counter; static and blinking 2D
both removed every 3D canvas. The 60px layout was restored. Typecheck, scoped
ESLint, asset audit (632 checked / 0 missing), and diff checks passed.

## Optional volumetric blinking

`3D blinking` adds a separate instanced upper/lower lid shell; the original
`3D eyeball` option retains its lid-free appearance. The lids wrap the globe,
with more upper-lid travel than lower-lid travel, a narrow rim/crease, and
continuous eased geometry rather than texture frames or squashing the eyeball.
Field gaze moves behind stationary lids; inspector rotation turns the complete
assembly. The detached lid shell is authored, not recovered CEO skin anatomy.

`blink all` works in both 3D modes, including pause/reduced motion. In the
baseline option it temporarily adds lids for one blink, then removes them.
In automatic mode it replaces the current blink without a queued extra blink.
Only loaded, viewport-intersecting outputs are targeted; no unloaded source
queues a future command. Duplicate identity outputs share the same blink.

Following user feedback, durations were slowed: closing 110–145 ms, closed
dwell 45–75 ms, reopening 170–220 ms, with a stable per-identity ±6% multiplier
and fresh per-blink samples. Typical total is approximately 0.31–0.47 seconds.
Recurring gaps are 2.5–7 seconds; occasional doubles are capped at one follow-up.
There are no independent per-eye timers. Pause/reduced motion suppress autonomy,
but explicit commands run once. Hidden documents stop the shared renderer.

Ownership: `model/eye-blink-3d.ts` (pure deterministic timing) and
`rendering/tech-eye-lids.ts` (optional geometry/material) are separate from both
the original eyeball surfaces and the independent 2D blink implementation.
The optional shell adds one instanced mesh: 9 calls / 803,520 submitted
triangles including capture; disabling it returns to 7 / 492,480.

The five pure tests cover timing variation, slower reopening, pause, capped
elapsed time, non-chaining doubles, and manual replacement across all 80 seeds.
HTTPS testing confirmed 73 loaded outputs closing on `blink all` while paused,
then reopening with the frame counter stopped and the original seven-call
baseline restored. Automatic partial/full closure was observed independently
across multiple identities. No new browser warnings/errors were captured.
The final slowed automatic mode loaded all 80 identities across 92 outputs;
a 33.86-second active interval measured 16.80 eye updates/s (24 Hz cap),
with 2.49 ms cumulative average CPU submission/copy work per update.
In a separate approximately 10-second DOM sample, 41 identities were observed
partially closing and 32 fully closing; inactive bubbles intentionally do not
blink. These are observed samples, not a guarantee that all 80 blink in a
fixed window. This verification does not measure GPU time or application FPS.
