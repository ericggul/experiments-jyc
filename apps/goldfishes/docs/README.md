# Goldfishes archive

Code lives at `components/<area>/<family>/<serial>/` (areas: `screen`, `pc`, `desktop`, `mobile`); docs mirror it at `docs/<area>/<family>/<serial>.md`. Serials rise with creation date: a later trial in a family always takes the next number. The registry (`components/experiments.ts`) is authoritative for routable experiments, ISO dates, and archive navigation; the navigation's group view (`?view=group`) reads lineages from `foundations/navigation/families.ts`, where each new trial should be added to its family (unassigned keys appear as "unsorted"). `screen/default` is the promoted baseline; archived routes must not be repurposed.

Dates are registry data, not folders. Date archives remain at `/<area>/<MMDD>` (for example `/screen/0908`, `/desktop/0915`, `/mobile/0930`) and list every experiment created that day or formerly filed under that dated folder.

Phone bubbles: `/mobile` → `/mobile/keyword-grid/{1,2}`. [Family index](./mobile/README.md).

Local macOS control: `/desktop` → independent versions [1](./desktop/native-windows/1.md), [2](./desktop/native-windows/2.md), [3](./desktop/native-windows/3.md) at `components/desktop/native-windows/{1,2,3}/`. Their control API stays at `/api/desktop/0915/{1,2,3}`; process control, app adapters, motion and controller primitives are shared in `components/desktop/native-windows/shared/` ([details](./desktop/native-windows/1.md#shared-infrastructure)). [Original fixed-score history](./pc/0915-desktop-a.md).

For a route change, read its document, the specific modules being changed, and the registry. Read [onboarding](./agent-onboarding.md) when creating or substantially changing a Goldfishes experiment; consult [history](./research-and-rendering-history.md) only for a relevant rendering, measurement, or historical-decision question.

Each experiment is a complete local copy: no cross-experiment implementation or ledger imports. Exception: the desktop native-windows versions share infrastructure through `components/desktop/native-windows/shared/`. Existing public images may be addressed by URL; only immutable company logos are a shared collection (`public/assets/goldfishes/assets/company-logos`). Asset URLs must exist inside this independently deployed app; after changing a collection, run `pnpm audit:goldfishes-assets`.

To add a trial, copy the nearest complete directory into the next serial of its family (`components/<area>/<family>/<n+1>`), or start `components/<area>/<new-family>/1`; mutate only that copy, register its ISO date, concise proposition and the family member, and record the essential decision and open question. Re-open the registry and this index immediately before a surgical patch: parallel work is expected.

Legacy URLs remain available as registry `legacyKeys`: every former dated route (`/screen/MMDD/name`, its root alias `/MMDD/name`, `/pc/MMDD/name`, `/desktop/0915/N`, `/mobile/0930/N`) resolves to its new route; `/default`, `/2d/1` resolve to their `/screen/...` counterparts; `/3d/1` → `/screen/default`; `/3d/2`, `/0804/1` → `/screen/attraction-targets/1`; `/3d/3`, `/0804/2` → `/screen/pillars/1`. Goldfishes has no client Socket.IO protocol; add one only for a concrete experiment under `socket/experiments/<experiment>/` with its own prefix and room.
