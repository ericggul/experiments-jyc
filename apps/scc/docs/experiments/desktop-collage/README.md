# desktop-collage

Direction recorded 2026-10-05. Area route: `/desktop-collage`. Implementation:
`components/desktop-collage/`.

## What this area is for

Many interfaces laid over one another. Tabs and windows used as collage
material, at a time when automated AI agents open, read and abandon pages faster
than anyone can attend to them. The work studies what this flood of content, and
the tab/browser/desktop that carries it, does visually, systemically,
affectively and, above all, **as a medium**. It continues collage through
papier collé and the Dada tradition: found, working material is cut, placed and
overlaid, and the joins stay visible. Image, feeling and rhythm are all part of
the result; none is a by-product of the others.

The material is the running computer: real browser windows with their own
loading, chrome, focus and failure. This follows the direction in
[splice/concept](../standalone/splice/concept.md). It is not a webcam or
face-tracking line of work; measurement of the participant is not this area's
subject.

Results here are meant to feed [Goldfishes](../../../../goldfishes/docs/README.md)
later. Proven variants are copied into that app rather than shared across apps.

## How it differs from its references

| | Authored web pieces | Screen recordings | desktop-collage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The work is | a page the artist made | a fixed video | a process on the actual operating system |
| It acts on | windows it created, with known content | a finished screen | real application state: windows, tabs, loading pages |
| Outcome | replays as authored | replays as recorded | the same score meets real latency, loading, minimum window sizes and errors; these stay in the result |

The references depict a computer; here the computer performs the collage.

## Structure

- `primitives/`: elementary gestures (shape, rhythm, order, material), each
  small enough to judge on its own.
  - [primitives/1](primitives/1.md): a heart of windows.
  - [primitives/2](primitives/2.md): entangled windows, one field across
    windows that connect when near.
- `hype/`: keyword-driven cascades of real and cloned pages with a reading
  agent.
  - [hype/1](hype/README.md): under the keyword AI, real pages and cloned
    services open at a stochastic rhythm while a reader scrolls, writes in
    the clones and follows links in the real pages.
- `foundations/`: the area's shared window machinery, grouped by function so
  later experiments can reuse and extend it. Every surface takes the same plan:
  rectangles in top-left desktop coordinates, a colour or page, and a stacking
  rank. "Clear all" removes everything a page opened.
  - `surfaces/index.ts` (browser-safe): the surfaces in order of preference,
    with what each supports.
    - `chrome-app/`: Chrome `--app` windows in a dedicated, throwaway Chrome
      instance, placed through its local DevTools endpoint. This is the main
      surface.
    - `terminal/`: Terminal windows painted a flat colour.
    - `bare/`: borderless windows held by one JXA host. Kept for other uses
      later.
  - `display/`: measures the desktop's visible frame.
  - `pages/`: self-contained colour pages as data URLs.
  - `jxa/`: runs `osascript -l JavaScript` processes and reads their events.
  - `control/`:
    - `definition.ts` (browser-safe): an experiment's `validate`, `plan` and
      optional `animate`. Each primitive keeps its own in `primitives/<n>/plan.ts`.
    - `core.ts`: the control state and actions (measure, start, stop, clear),
      one run at a time.
    - `run.ts`: sends a plan to the right surface and clears everything.
    - `index.ts`: the route handler. It runs only on the local HTTPS
      development server on macOS.
    - An optional `animate` hook keeps moving opened windows (chrome app
      windows can be moved through DevTools).
  - `browser/`: the fallback where no Mac control answers. The same plan opens
    as pop-up windows from this page. Pop-ups keep a slim address bar, and
    newest is always in front. A browser lets one pop-up through per click
    until pop-ups are allowed for the site.
  - `controller/`: the shared control page: frame, parameter rows, and the
    control hook.
- `helper/`: the Mac helper. It serves the same `core.ts` for pages from any
  approved origin, so a page on Vercel opens the same Chrome app, Terminal and
  bare windows as the local development server does.

## Running from anywhere (2026-10-06)

The control page picks who opens the windows, in this order:
1. **Route:** the page's own route, on the local HTTPS development server on
   macOS.
2. **Mac helper:** `https://127.0.0.1:2099`, probed only from a Mac browser,
   and probed again every 5 s while browser windows are in use.
3. **Browser windows:** everywhere else.

Route and helper run the same control code, so the windows are identical.
Windows load pages from the origin of the controlling page: the Vercel
deployment when it is opened there.

The helper:
- Start it on the Mac with `pnpm desktop-collage:helper` from the repository
  root. It uses the repository's local certificates, whose root the Mac
  already trusts for the development server.
- It listens on loopback only. It answers only approved origins:
  `https://scc-jyc.vercel.app` and the local development addresses; add more
  with `DESKTOP_COLLAGE_ORIGINS`.
- It plans every window itself from validated settings, so a page cannot ask
  it to open anything else.
- Chrome asks once whether the Vercel page may reach devices on the local
  network (Private Network Access / Local Network Access); the helper answers
  the preflight for it.
