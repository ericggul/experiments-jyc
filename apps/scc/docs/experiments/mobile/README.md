# Mobile experiments

The component family is `apps/scc/components/mobile/`. Its `clone/1`–`clone/13` entries preserve the SNS mobile variants; the public routes remain `/sns/mobile/1`–`/sns/mobile/13` so existing links continue to work. Their individual records remain in [SNS mobile](../sns/mobile/README.md).

`finger-skating/default` (formerly `/1`) is a single-device arrow field changed by a moving finger at [`/mobile/finger-skating/default`](../../../app/mobile/finger-skating/[experiment]/page.tsx); opt 3 deposits vorticity into a still fluid layer. See [finger skating](finger-skating.md).

Removed 2026-10-07: `finger-skating/2` (skated curve read back as a formula); its code and notes remain in git history before that date.

`finger-skating/clock` lists finger-skated experiments that live in other families, at [`/mobile/finger-skating/clock`](../../../app/mobile/finger-skating/clock/page.tsx): [`fractal/clock/2` and `/3`](../complex-systems/fractal/clock/README.md). They are tagged with `also` in `foundations/navigation/experiments.ts`; their code and routes stay in `fractal`.

`finger-skating/road-sign/1` lists [`transportation/road-signs/direction/4`](../standalone/transportation/road-signs/direction/4.md) at [`/mobile/finger-skating/road-sign`](../../../app/mobile/finger-skating/road-sign/page.tsx); the alias sets its own name with `slug: "1"`.

`ui-collage/` tiles the screen with faithful clones of everyday components and lets finger skating play them: `loading/1` is a grid of twelve circular phone loaders, `loading/2` stacks full-width progress bars from MS-DOS Setup onward (loading/1 restarts at 0% where a finger crosses; loading/2 jumps to the crossing position), and `sliders/1` is a row of narrow vertical sliders set to the finger's height. See [ui-collage](ui-collage/README.md).

`lucky-ticket/1`–`/3` are full-viewport scratch-off fortunes with one-line, long-form, and scattered-word presentations at [`/mobile/lucky-ticket/[experiment]`](../../../app/mobile/lucky-ticket/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [lucky ticket](lucky-ticket.md).

`arithmetic/default` sets the four Instagram post actions — 사칙연산 — large in one row in Instagram's dark-mode colours; `arithmetic/1` is a working iOS 27 Calculator clone. Both are at [`/mobile/arithmetic/[experiment]`](../../../app/mobile/arithmetic/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [사칙연산](arithmetic.md).

`face-trace/1` keeps the live eye and mouth cutouts inside a full-screen `face-voronoi/3` `face-gradient 3` lattice made only of those features and their short echoes. Opening the mouth swells and melts the lattice outward from the mouth. It is at [`/mobile/face-trace/1`](../../../app/mobile/face-trace/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [face trace](face-trace.md).

`finger-network/1` maps each active mobile touch to a node and joins every pair at [`/mobile/finger-network/1`](../../../app/mobile/finger-network/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [finger network](finger-network.md).

`finger-network/2` keeps the network baseline and turns two to five active touches into a continuously moving 2D human figure whose freedom grows with the finger count at [`/mobile/finger-network/2`](../../../app/mobile/finger-network/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [finger network /2](finger-network-2.md).

`finger-network/3` copies `/1`'s network but keeps every node after its finger lifts; each touch session is a complete graph, earlier sessions join only nearby nodes, and an option raises a stick figure per session at [`/mobile/finger-network/3`](../../../app/mobile/finger-network/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [finger network /3](finger-network-3.md).

`finger-network/4` starts from `/3` with people on and keeps each session's person: when the fingers lift it joins, by a bottom option, either a one-sex society of couples, children, betrayal, divorce, ageing, and death, or a political landscape where height is opinion (상파 above, 하파 below), at [`/mobile/finger-network/4`](../../../app/mobile/finger-network/[experiment]/page.tsx). See [finger network /4](finger-network-4.md).

`gaze-tracking/1` preserves the independent camera-input study. The [`/mobile/gaze-tracking`](../../../app/mobile/gaze-tracking/page.tsx) index also links to `gaze-tracking/2`, which applies gaze-driven difference circles, liquid displacement, or a local-curl mesh distortion to each of the 13 clones. See [gaze tracking](gaze-tracking.md) for the sensing and accuracy boundary.

`transform/pixelate/` applies one shared viewport raster effect to any of the 13 archived clones without editing them. The selection index is at [`/mobile/transform/pixelate`](../../../app/mobile/transform/pixelate/page.tsx). See [pixelate](pixelate.md) for its rendering and interaction boundary.

`transform/substitution/1` switches between the original clone, object outlines, and representative colors. `substitution/2` adds uppercase command readings in three vocabulary groups, with an original mode. Both share one renderer across all 13 clones. The selection index is at [`/mobile/transform/substitution`](../../../app/mobile/transform/substitution/page.tsx). See [substitution](substitution.md).

`transform/language/1` hides the glyphs of every recognised interface string in a clone and redraws them in one of 40 literal translations; each button or text block changes language on its own Markov chain, optionally coupled to its on-screen neighbours, at up to 60 steps per second. The selection index is at [`/mobile/transform/language`](../../../app/mobile/transform/language/page.tsx). See [language](language.md).

`transform/decomposition/` takes the interface in front apart into atoms (text runs, icons, images, fills and borders) and sorts the copies by structural category (every time beside every time, every heart beside every heart), still clickable; a bottom toggle animates between original and decomposition, and new screens or modals are decomposed as they open. The selection index is at [`/mobile/transform/decomposition`](../../../app/mobile/transform/decomposition/page.tsx). See [decomposition](decomposition.md).

`transform/finger-decomposition/` draws the clone in WebGL on a liquid sheet. A finger holds the element under it and carries it rigidly, while the rest of the interface flows, stretches, and eddies around it continuously and keeps flowing briefly after release. A tap still reaches the live page. The selection index is at [`/mobile/transform/finger-decomposition`](../../../app/mobile/transform/finger-decomposition/page.tsx). See [finger decomposition](finger-decomposition.md).
